      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

      <h3>BIO</h3>
      <q
        >I am an introvert who will express myself confidently around those I am
        comfortable with. I have good leadership skills and I know how to stand
        up for myself and others and know what's wrong and what's right. I enjoy
        meeting new people and exploring new things.</q
      >
      <h3>Where did your passion for coding start:</h3>
      <q
        >I started being interested in tech when I was younger and I helped
        build my first PC. For a long time, I could not do anything in tech
        because my high school did not offer subjects in tech. My passion for
        tech continued because I was always interested in how smartphones and
        computers worked and continued to use these in my everyday life.</q
